
# Gravettian Peoples in Present-Day Russia

The Gravettian was a mid-Upper Paleolithic cultural complex (\~30,000–20,000 years BP) that extended across Europe, including into the territory of modern Russia. In Russia, Gravettian groups left behind remarkable archaeological sites with rich material culture, showcasing advanced tools, art, and adaptations to Ice Age environments. Although the Gravettian is often seen as a **“vast meta-culture”** – a patchwork of regional traditions across Paleolithic Europe – the Russian Plain hosts a distinctive cluster often termed the **Kostenki–Avdeevo culture**, reflecting a local Gravettian facies strongly linked to Central European counterparts. What follows is a comprehensive overview of these Gravettian peoples in present-day Russia, covering key sites, technologies, art and symbolism, settlement and migration, genetics, subsistence, and the climatic context of their era.

## Major Gravettian Sites in Russia

Several important open-air sites on the East European Plain (and beyond, into Siberia) document the presence of Gravettian groups in what is now Russia. These sites have yielded rich evidence of habitation, toolmaking, art, and even human burials:

* **Kostenki–Borshchevo Complex (Voronezh Oblast)** – A cluster of at least 20 Paleolithic sites on the Don River, Kostenki is one of the most significant Upper Paleolithic localities in the world. Gravettian levels at Kostenki (e.g. Kostenki 1 Layer I, Kostenki 4, Kostenki 9, Kostenki 11,  etc.) date roughly 25,000–23,000 BP and contain hearth-centered living features, mammoth-bone structures, diverse flint tools, and Venus figurines. For example, **Kostenki 1** and **Kostenki 13/18** feature linear arrangements of hearths surrounded by pits filled with large animal bones (possibly used for storage or windbreaks), as well as carved ivory figurines and evidence of early ceramic technology (fired clay objects). A spectacular recent discovery at **Kostenki 11** is a 12.5 m circular enclosure built from the bones of at least 60 mammoths (\~25,000 years old), with traces of internal fires and food remains – an “Ice Age architecture” whose purpose (dwelling, storage, or ritual) remains debated. Kostenki has also yielded human burials (e.g. a child burial at Kostenki 18) directly associated with Gravettian tools.

* **Avdeevo (Kursk Oblast)** – Located on the Sejm River near Kursk, Avdeevo is a key site of the Kostenki–Avdeevo cultural group. Excavations revealed two oval living areas encircled by semi-subterranean lodges and pits, occupied \~21,000–20,000 BP. The settlement layout and cultural remains at Avdeevo are strikingly similar to those at Kostenki, indicating a shared cultural tradition across sites. Avdeevo is especially renowned for its art: at least 20 carved **Venus figurines** of women (depicting various stages of the reproductive cycle) were found here, establishing Avdeevo as one of the rich assemblages of Paleolithic portable art. The site also contained large hearths, flint workshops, and bone debris, suggesting a long-term encampment.

* **Zaraysk (Moscow Oblast)** – Farther north on the Russian Plain, Zaraysk was a Gravettian settlement (\~21–20k BP) that represents the northernmost extension of the Kostenki–Avdeevo culture. Discoveries at Zaraysk include at least two **Venus figurines** (one 17 cm tall finished statuette and a smaller unfinished one) carefully buried in storage pits and covered by mammoth shoulder blades. These figurines closely resemble those from Avdeevo, underscoring strong cultural links. Zaraysk has also yielded other artwork, such as a mammoth ivory rod engraved with dense motifs (possibly a **spindle-like object**) and a mammoth rib bone carved with images of mammoths. The richness and variety of art objects at Zaraysk put it “on a par with such famous sites as Kostenki and Avdeevo” according to researchers. In addition, a human deciduous tooth found at Zaraysk hints at the presence of children at the site.

* **Gagarino (Lipetsk Oblast)** – A Gravettian site on the Don basin of Russia, dated roughly 22,000–21,000 BP. Gagarino is noted for the discovery of multiple **female figurines** (including the unique “double statuette” carved from a single mammoth ivory rod) and for its rich bone/ivory industry. Excavations uncovered remains of dwellings or **huts** and evidence of large-scale mammoth hunting. The artifacts – such as shouldered stone points and Venus figurines – align Gagarino with the **Kostenki-Willendorf (Eastern Gravettian) culture**. In other words, Gagarino’s inhabitants were mammoth hunters of the same Eastern Gravettian tradition, crafting abundant bone and ivory objects (especially the **copious Venus statuettes**) and likely building shelters from bones and hides.

* **Sunghir (Vladimir Oblast)** – Although slightly earlier than the “classic” Gravettian period (dated \~34,000 BP), Sunghir is an Upper Paleolithic site often associated with the early Gravettian in Russia. It is famous for the **elaborate burials** of an adult male and two children, interred with extraordinary grave goods. Over 13,000 ivory beads, meticulously crafted and sewn onto clothing, were found with the burials, along with jewelry, pierced fox teeth pendants, and long spears made from straightened mammoth tusks. The bodies were dusted in red ochre pigment, indicating complex ritual behavior. Sunghir provides a window into the social and symbolic life of Eastern Gravettian (or proto-Gravettian) people, revealing social differentiation (e.g. lavish child burials) and long-distance exchange (the marine shell beads at Sunghir came from distant sources).

* **Mal’ta-Buret’ (Irkutsk Oblast, Siberia)** – Though geographically far to the east, the Mal’ta and Buret’ sites near Lake Baikal in Siberia (24,000–20,000 BP) are sometimes considered an eastern extension or parallel of Gravettian culture. The **Mal’ta–Buret’ culture** produced its own style of portable art, including several stone and ivory **Venus figurines of Mal’ta** that share the Gravettian tradition of depicting nude female figures. The Mal’ta site yielded carved representations of birds and animals as well, and the grave of a young boy (Mal’ta MA-1) with rich adornments (pendants, an ivory crown) similar in extravagance to European Gravettian burials. Culturally, Mal’ta’s lithics are described as “Gravettian-like” and the presence of Venus-type figurines suggests at least a conceptual link to the broader Gravettian artistic sphere. (Notably, Mal’ta also provided a crucial ancient DNA sample, discussed below.)

These sites collectively demonstrate that Gravettian hunter-gatherers were well-established across present-day Russian territories – from the plains of European Russia to the fringes of Siberia – by the mid Upper Paleolithic. Each site contributes unique insights, but they also show a coherent pattern of lifeways as detailed in the following sections.

## Tools and Technologies of the Gravettian in Russia

Gravettian groups in Russia employed a sophisticated toolkit of stone, bone, antler, and ivory implements. Their toolkits were adapted for efficient hunting of Pleistocene megafauna as well as processing of hides, wood, and other materials needed for survival in cold steppe environments. Archaeological assemblages from Kostenki, Avdeevo, and related sites have yielded **distinctive stone tool types** that characterize the Gravettian “technocomplex”:

* **Lithic Tools:** Russian Gravettian sites are rich in **blade and bladelet technology**. Long, straight stone blades were struck from prepared cores to serve as knives or blanks for further retouch. A hallmark is the production of *backed bladelets* (small blades with one dulled, backed edge) that were likely used as insets in composite projectiles. At Kostenki 9, for instance, archaeologists found a “highly homogeneous assemblage of ventrally truncated backed bladelets,” essentially small sharp points ideal for mounting in spear or dart shafts. Larger points were also made on blades – including **shouldered points** and **leaf-shaped (lanceolate) points** – which are considered diagnostic of Eastern Gravettian industries. The term **“Kostenki points”** is used for particular bifacially worked points common in these assemblages. Also common are **end-scrapers** (for hide-working) and **burins** (chisel-like tools to carve bone/ivory). Taken together, the stone toolkit was versatile: razor-sharp blades and points for hunting weapons, scrapers for processing animal skins, burins for crafting artifacts, and various flakes and knives for cutting tasks.

* **Bone and Ivory Tools:** The Russian Gravettians made extensive use of animal hard materials for tools and equipment. At Avdeevo, for example, excavators uncovered a “well-preserved series of worked bone objects,” including **numerous bone awls and points**, smoothing tools (**burnishers**), large ivory implements called “shovels” (possibly used for digging in permafrost or processing hides), and even personal ornaments like **diadems (headbands) and bracelets**. The presence of eyed **bone needles** is of great significance – indeed, some of the **oldest known eyed sewing needles** were discovered in the Kostenki area (e.g. at Kostenki 14 Layer II) in occupation layers dated to \~28–27k BP. This indicates that Gravettian people could stitch fitted clothing, crucial for survival in glacial climates. Large mammal bones (mammoth limb bones, antler) were shaped into projectile points and possibly **spear thrower** components (though the atlatl itself is evidenced more clearly in later periods). The use of mammoth ivory was especially prolific – not only for art objects but also utilitarian tools. For instance, split mammoth ribs and tusk fragments at these sites were fashioned into **sled runners or half-round rods** for unknown purposes, and mammoth shoulder blades could be used as digging tools or as roof supports in dwellings.

* **Early Ceramics and Pyrotechnology:** An intriguing technological facet of the Gravettian (especially in Eastern Europe) is the **invention of fired clay objects**. At Kostienki and some Central European sites, archaeologists have found fragments of baked clay figurines – the world’s earliest ceramics. There is *“evidence for Gravettian fired ceramic technology”* in the Kostenki-Avdeevo context, contemporary with the famous fired clay Venus of Dolní Věstonice in Moravia (\~26k BP). This suggests that Gravettian people in Russia knew how to use controlled heat not just for warmth or cooking, but also for creating art, indicating advanced pyrotechnological skills. They also used fire innovatively in daily life: because wood was scarce on the Mammoth Steppe, Gravettians fueled their campfires with bones. Many camp hearths contain charred bone fragments, implying that *“most of the fuel at these sites appears to have been bone”* due to the paucity of firewood.

Overall, the toolkit of the Gravettians in Russia reflects a **highly specialized big-game hunting adaptation**. The prevalence of stout projectile points (likely used on spears or darts) and robust butchery tools corresponds to a lifestyle centered on hunting large fauna. Meanwhile, fine instruments like eyed needles, awls, and bead polishers show attention to garment-making and ornamentation. In essence, these peoples had the tools not only to **kill mammoths and bison**, but also to transform animal carcasses into clothing, shelter, and art – a complete technological package for Upper Paleolithic survival.

## Art and Symbolic Expression

One of the hallmarks of the Gravettian world is its flourishing of artistic and symbolic behavior, and the territories of present-day Russia are no exception. Archaeological evidence reveals that Gravettian groups in this region engaged in sophisticated artistic expression, from the crafting of iconic **Venus figurines** to personal ornaments and possibly ritual structures. Key aspects of their symbolic culture include:

* **Venus Figurines:** The **Paleolithic “Venus” figurines** – stylized depictions of women with exaggerated sexual features – are among the most famous artifacts of the Gravettian, and numerous examples come from Russian sites. At **Kostenki**, several female statuettes (carved in mammoth ivory or molded in marl clay) have been found, typically dated \~24–21k BP. **Avdeevo** yielded one of the largest collections of such figurines in Eastern Europe: about two dozen sculptures of females, varying in style from full-figured matronly shapes to more schematic forms. **Gagarino** likewise produced Venus figurines, including a unique double-figure carving (two torsos back-to-back) interpreted as two women in the process of being carved from a single piece. At **Zaraysk**, as mentioned, two figurines were discovered buried in pits with careful placement of colored sands and ochre, hinting at ceremonial deposition. These Eastern European Venuses closely resemble those found further west (e.g. Willendorf in Austria, Dolní Věstonice in Czechia) and even those as far as Siberia, indicating a **wide geographic spread of this symbolic tradition**. Their cultural significance is debated – they might relate to fertility rituals, social identity, or shared mythologies – but their deliberate crafting and deposition (often in dwellings or pits) signal a complex symbolic life.

* **Personal Ornaments:** The Gravettian peoples in Russia adorned themselves and their clothing with a variety of personal ornaments. Thousands of **small beads** have been found, typically made from mammoth ivory or ostrich eggshell (the latter likely traded from far to the south). For instance, Sunghir’s burials had **over 13,000 ivory beads** sewn onto garments, an almost unimaginable investment of labor (\~10,000 hours to produce that many tiny beads) which underscores the ritual or status importance of decoration. At other sites, beads and pendants crafted from **animal teeth** (fox canines, deer teeth) and **marine shells** have been recovered – the shells often coming from distant Black Sea or Mediterranean shores, implying **long-distance exchange networks**. Avdeevo’s artifact inventory included **ivory bracelets and diadems (headbands)**, suggesting that Gravettian individuals wore conspicuous regalia, possibly as markers of group identity, age, sex, or achievement. The use of red ochre in burials and possibly on bodies (as seen at Sunghir) further indicates body ornamentation and symbolic coloring.

* **Parietal and Engraved Art:** While mobiliary (portable) art dominates the record in open-air camps, there are also examples of engravings and other visual art. At Zaraysk, a mammoth rib was engraved with the outlines of **three woolly mammoths** walking in file – a figurative artwork that not only depicts important prey animals but might symbolize communal hunts or cosmological themes. Another find from Zaraysk is a small bone with a **cross-hatched engraved pattern**, reflecting the use of abstract geometric motifs. Such engraved patterns are common throughout the Upper Paleolithic (possibly as personal marks or aesthetic designs). Deeper in Siberia, the Mal’ta site yielded carved anthropomorphic and zoomorphic figurines (women, birds, etc.) and ornamented plaques, indicating that similarly rich artistic traditions extended across Eurasia by this time. Although cave art (wall painting) is mainly known from Western Europe, a few caves in the Urals region (e.g. Kapova and Ignatievka caves in the southern Urals) preserve red ochre cave paintings of animals that might date to the late Gravettian or shortly after, hinting that parietal art was not entirely absent in the east.

* **Burial Rituals and Social Symbolism:** The elaborate **Gravettian burials** found in Russia are highly symbolic behaviors in themselves. The interment of individuals with abundant grave goods (Sunghir’s bead-laden burials, or the newly reported child burial at Kostenki 18 which was accompanied by ochre and grave inclusions) suggests ritual treatment of the dead and possibly belief in an afterlife or the need to equip the deceased for another existence. The use of ochre (a red iron oxide pigment) to sprinkle on bodies or graves – observed at Sunghir and other Eastern European burials – likely had ritual meaning, perhaps signifying blood, life force, or purification. The fact that grave goods include items of daily life (tools, beads, clothing) and extraordinary items (like Sunghir’s long spears of carved mammoth ivory) indicates a complex social structure where certain individuals (perhaps of high status or specific social roles) were commemorated specially. Moreover, recent genetic studies of Gravettian-era burials in Russia (Sunghir) show that the individuals buried together were *not* close relatives (the two adolescents at Sunghir were not siblings), suggesting these ceremonial burials were not simply family tombs but had broader social significance – possibly representing alliances or social ritual groups in these hunter-gatherer societies.

In sum, the artistic and symbolic output of the Gravettian peoples in Russia was rich and multifaceted. From the iconic female figurines and ornamental beads to engraved art and lavish burials, these expressions point to a people with a well-developed **symbolic culture**. They likely shared myths or beliefs that found tangible form in small sculptures and burial rites, maintained **personal adornment traditions** that reinforced group identity or beauty, and perhaps even built large structures with not just practical but also symbolic or ritual dimensions (as the mysterious mammoth-bone circles might imply). This creative and cognitive world was on par with, and connected to, that of Gravettian groups elsewhere in Upper Paleolithic Europe.

## Settlement Patterns and Mobility

Gravettian groups in the Russian region were hunter-gatherers who had to adapt their settlement strategies to a harsh Ice Age environment. Archaeological evidence suggests a pattern of **semi-sedentary base camps** combined with high mobility on a seasonal basis. Key aspects of their settlement and migration patterns include:

* **Open-Air Base Camps:** Unlike earlier Upper Paleolithic cultures that sometimes used caves, the Gravettians of the East European Plain mostly occupied open-air sites, often on river terraces or loess plateaus near water sources. Sites like Kostenki, Avdeevo, and Zaraysk were likely large base camps inhabited for extended periods (perhaps seasonally, or re-visited annually). These camps feature substantial living structures – such as the **oval lodge foundations at Avdeevo** or the **mammoth-bone houses at Kostenki** – indicating that people invested significant effort to construct durable shelters. The shelters could be semisunken huts ringed by mammoth bones and earth (to insulate from cold and wind) or tipi-like tents anchored with heavy bones. For example, at Kostenki 2 and 11, archaeologists found collapsed rings of mammoth bones, which when intact would have formed walls of circular huts \~7–8 meters across, containing central hearths. These structures often had multiple hearths and pits around them, suggesting multi-family encampments or repeated rebuilding on the same spot. The clustering of many sites in the Kostenki area hints that groups congregated in resource-rich locales (perhaps near migratory game crossing points or chert outcrops) and built semi-permanent villages of huts there.

* **Seasonal Mobility:** Despite their investment in base camps, Gravettian hunter-gatherers were not year-round sedentary. They most likely followed a **seasonal round**, moving their camps in tune with migrating herds and climate cycles. During moderate seasons (spring and fall), bands might aggregate at large sites like Kostenki to hunt herd animals (e.g. horses at waterholes, as evidenced by mass horse bone deposits in some layers) and to engage in mating or social exchange. During the dead of winter, some groups may have wintered in well-built camps (the mammoth-bone houses could have served as winter dwellings, providing shelter and stored food), whereas others possibly moved to sheltered refuges (e.g. southward to forested river valleys or the foothills). The presence of *“ice-cellar”* pits dug to permafrost at Kostenki – presumably to keep meat and bone fuel from spoiling – suggests that people planned to stay in one place long enough to store and consume provisions, consistent with multi-month occupation at a site. Conversely, certain high upland or short-term kill sites (identified by butchery tools and animal remains with fewer domestic traces) might represent temporary hunting stations used by task groups, after which the band returned to main camps.

* **Migration and Expansion:** The Gravettian presence in Russia appears to result from an **eastward expansion of Upper Paleolithic populations**. Archaeological parallels show that the industries in central and eastern Europe were closely related. Scholars note the *“absolute similarity of all their components – type of settlement, flint and bone tools, art objects – \[which] argues for total identity”* among sites of the Kostenki-Avdeevo culture and their Central European counterparts. This likely means that groups carrying the Gravettian toolkit and traditions moved from central/eastern Europe into the plains of Russia around 30,000 years ago. Indeed, early stages of this culture (so-called *“Proto-Gravettian”*) are documented at Kostenki around 32–30k BP. Over the following millennia, these groups spread over a vast area – as reflected by the distribution of Venus figurines from Spain to Siberia. It is possible that the Russian Plain served as a corridor for human movements further east: the appearance of Gravettian-like cultures in Siberia by \~24k (e.g. Mal’ta) might be linked to peoples moving out of Eastern Europe or via Central Asia. Genetic evidence (discussed below) indeed suggests gene flow between European Gravettians and Siberian populations.

* **Settlement Hiatus at the LGM:** As the climate reached its most frigid peak during the Last Glacial Maximum (\~21,000 ± 2,000 years BP), the Russian Gravettian settlements seem to have contracted or temporarily disappeared in some areas. Paleoenvironmental data and site chronologies indicate a **hiatus in occupation around 23,000–20,000 BP** on the central Russian Plain. For example, at Kostenki almost no cultural layers date to the LGM proper – after intensive habitation up to \~22k BP, there’s a gap until reoccupation after \~18k BP. This suggests that as conditions became extremely cold/dry, with permafrost deepening and prey animals perhaps scarcer or migrating away, humans abandoned the most exposed northern sites. They likely retreated to glacial refugia – possibly the relatively milder areas to the southwest (Ukraine, Balkans) or the south (Caucasus or Central Asia). Some Eastern European Gravettian groups may have survived the LGM in refuges such as the Crimea or the northern Black Sea steppes, developing into what is called the **Epigravettian** culture which later re-expanded. Indeed, after \~17k BP, sites in Ukraine and Russia (e.g. Mezhirich in Ukraine; Yudinovo in Bryansk region, Russia) show people returning and building large mammoth-bone houses on the plains, likely descendants of Gravettian populations reclaiming territory as the climate warmed slightly. Thus, the Gravettian story in Russia includes not only expansion but also contraction and cultural continuity into the Epigravettian of the Late Glacial period.

In summary, Gravettian groups in Russia can be seen as **adaptive strategists**, establishing sizeable camps in resource-rich spots, yet maintaining mobility to exploit seasonally available game herds. They built substantial shelters when needed and even engineered food storage solutions for the long glacial winters. Their movements and contacts linked them with distant communities, facilitating a broad cultural network from Europe into Asia. However, they were not immune to climatic adversity – the severest cold of the LGM forced migrations and reorganization of their settlement pattern, setting the stage for the next phase of Upper Paleolithic culture after the Gravettian.

## Genetic and Anthropological Insights

In recent years, ancient DNA and physical anthropology have shed light on the origins and population relationships of Gravettian-era humans, including those in present-day Russia. The emerging picture is one of a genetically diverse metapopulation with deep roots in earlier Eurasian populations, and with complex connections between east and west. Key findings include:

* **Origins and Genetic Continuity:** Genomic studies indicate that the Gravettian peoples in Eastern Europe (including Russia) were descended from the **first wave of modern humans that entered Europe** around 45,000–40,000 years ago. Notably, the genome of a man from Kostenki 14 (Markina Gora) in Russia (\~38,000 BP) has been identified as an important ancestral lineage for later Europeans. Researchers have found that *“genetic ancestry from Kostenki 14 has been found in all individuals associated with the Gravettian culture”* – in other words, the Gravettian populations across Europe seem to carry a legacy of that early Eurasian lineage (sometimes called the “Kostenki cluster”). This suggests a degree of continuity: by the time of the Gravettian (30k–20k BP), many groups from France to Russia shared common ancestors dating back \~10,000 years earlier, even if they had differentiated into regional bands.

* **Population Structure:** Despite some common ancestry, ancient DNA reveals a **genetic distinction between different Gravettian groups**. A recent paleogenomic analysis found that individuals associated with Gravettian culture in western Europe had a different genetic profile from those in central/eastern Europe. In particular, a “Věstonice cluster” of genomes (named after Dolní Věstonice in Czechia) represents Gravettians in Central/East Europe, while a more westerly cluster (including individuals from Belgium and France) shows links to an earlier Aurignacian-associated lineage. The **Sunghir individuals** (Russia, \~34k BP) and some Kostenki individuals form an **Eastern Gravettian genetic cluster** that contributed heavily to the Central European Gravettians. For example, DNA from Sunghir and Kostenki 12 shows close affinity to the genomes of later Gravettian people in Moravia (Czechia). By contrast, Gravettians from southwest Europe (e.g. in Italy) had more of the older Western European lineage. This implies that during the Gravettian period, there were at least two interconnected but distinguishable gene pools in Europe – one centered more to the east (Russian Plain and Central Europe) and another to the west – likely reflecting partial isolation and different refugial histories during the LGM.

* **Links to Siberia and Wider Eurasia:** The territory of Russia also provides crucial evidence of connections between European and Asian populations. The genome of the boy from **Mal’ta (Siberia)** (\~24,000 BP) revealed a genetic profile known as **Ancient North Eurasian (ANE)**, which is particularly important as a ancestor to later peoples of Siberia and the Americas. Intriguingly, the Mal’ta genome shows a mix of affinities – partially related to West Eurasian Upper Paleolithic groups and partially distinct. This suggests that some **Gravettian-era groups migrated eastward and mixed with Asian populations**. In fact, the Mal’ta boy’s Y-chromosome was of haplogroup R, linking him distantly to West Eurasian lineages. Geneticists infer that **Siberian hunter-gatherers like Mal’ta (and later Afontova Gora)** carried a high proportion of the ANE ancestry component, which in turn likely originated from a Gravettian-or-older founder population that had spread from Europe into Siberia. Thus, the human groups in Ice Age Russia were part of a **genetic continuum across northern Eurasia** – for example, an individual from Buran-Kaya (Crimea, \~30k BP) and the Mal’ta individual share significant ancestry despite the geographic distance. This east-west genetic linkage is further evidenced by later periods: by the end of the Ice Age, European hunter-gatherers show small proportions of ANE-related ancestry, hinting at a two-way gene flow between Europe (Gravettian descendants) and Siberia.

* **Physical Anthropology:** Fossil human remains from Gravettian contexts in Russia (and nearby) show fully modern human anatomy with some robust Ice-Age adaptations. Crania from Sunghir and Kostenki display features typical of early Europeans (e.g. relatively large cranial capacity, broad faces). Postcranial skeletons, like the Sunghir male, show that these people were tall (Sunghir I man stood \~177 cm) and strongly built, with thick cortical bone – perhaps an adaptation to a strenuous life in cold climate. The two adolescents from Sunghir exhibited normal development, but interestingly, one had a congenital condition (femoral deformation) – yet he was buried with equal honors, indicating care for individuals with disabilities in Gravettian societies. Comparative analysis of skull shapes across Europe finds that Gravettian people formed a remarkably homogeneous group phenetically, more so than the populations after the LGM. This supports the genetic evidence of a coherent meta-population and suggests that the Gravettian “mosaic” culture corresponded to a real breeding population spread over vast territory. After the LGM, there was a break in continuity – later populations (Magdalenian, etc.) appear somewhat different, implying some degree of population turnover or new admixtures after the Gravettian period.

In summary, genetic and skeletal data portray the Gravettian inhabitants of Russia as an **integral part of the early European human stock**, sharing ancestry with their western contemporaries while also forging connections with populations further east. They were descendants of the first modern humans in Europe (as evidenced by the Kostenki genome link) and in turn became ancestors to later Eurasian groups. The **social structure** gleaned from genomic analysis is also illuminating: a recent study of Sunghir and other Upper Paleolithic genomes found that individuals within a local group were not closely related, suggesting **exogamous mating patterns** (different bands exchanging mates) and **large social networks** rather than small isolated family units. This fits the view of Gravettian societies as relatively fluid hunter-gatherer bands with extensive interconnections across the landscape – a trait that would aid in maintaining genetic diversity and spreading cultural innovations.

## Subsistence Strategies and Megafauna Interaction

The Gravettian peoples in Russia lived during a time of megafaunal abundance – mammoths, woolly rhinoceroses, bison, reindeer, and horses roamed the periglacial steppes. These animals were central to Gravettian subsistence, providing food, fuel, raw materials, and even building supplies. Key aspects of their subsistence and interactions with megafauna include:

* **Big-Game Hunting:** The Russian Gravettian economy was heavily based on **hunting large herd animals**, especially the **woolly mammoth**. Faunal remains at Eastern Gravettian sites are dominated by mammoth bones, indicating that these groups successfully hunted (or at least scavenged) these massive creatures. They likely employed coordinated hunting strategies for such dangerous prey, perhaps targeting younger or female mammoths from herds or driving animals into natural traps. The mammoth was an all-purpose resource: its meat provided huge quantities of protein and fat; its bones and tusks provided raw material for tools, art, and dwellings; its hides could be used for shelters or clothing. Alongside mammoths, other large herbivores were staple game: reindeer and wild horse remains are also common, suggesting seasonal focus on migrating reindeer in winter and horse in warmer seasons. At some Kostenki localities, specific kill-butchery episodes have been identified (e.g. a mass horse kill at Kostenki 15) where dozens of horse carcasses were processed, possibly representing communal hunts. Likewise, bones of **bison and giant deer** occasionally appear, indicating broad-spectrum big game hunting. The prevalence of shouldered and backed points in their toolkit attests to a weaponry geared for large prey – likely spears or javelins thrown with atlatls to maintain distance from dangerous animals. There is also evidence that they exploited **woolly rhinoceros** opportunistically (bones found at some sites), though mammoths overshadow rhinos in most faunal lists.

* **Use of Megafauna for Shelter and Fuel:** Uniquely, Gravettian groups on the Russian Plain used mammoth bones in substantial quantities to construct their living structures. This implies not only hunting but systematic **collecting of carcasses** and transport of bones. Many mammoth bones at sites are *“weathered”* or show signs of long exposure, suggesting that people gathered skeletal remains from natural deaths or previous kills to reuse them. At Kostenki and Yudinovo, mammoth skulls, jawbones, tusks and long bones were arranged in circular patterns forming the foundations of huts. Some huts used dozens of mammoths (Kostenki 11’s bone circle used bones of at least 60 mammoths as noted) in a single structure. These bone houses provided insulation and windbreak on the treeless steppe – an ingenious use of available resources in a landscape with almost no wood. Additionally, as mentioned, mammoth and other herbivore bones doubled as **fuel for fires**. The fat-rich bones (especially marrow and spongy bone) burn well once dried, and Gravettians routinely burned bones in their hearths. Archaeologists even found pits that might have served as **“ice cellars”** – dug into permafrost to keep bone and meat frozen for later use, ensuring a supply of food and fuel through the winter. Such evidence underscores a sophisticated strategy of caching resources, likely to hedge against lean seasons.

* **Dietary Breadth:** While big game provided the bulk of calories, Gravettian foragers did not rely exclusively on mammoth steaks. They exploited a range of smaller game and plant foods as well. Remains of fur-bearing animals like **fox, hare, wolf** are commonly found alongside the megafauna bones. Foxes and hares may have been trapped for their fur (to make warm clothing) and also eaten. Wolves/dogs might have been present either as wild scavengers or possibly as early domesticates (some studies suggest wolf interactions at sites like Eliseevichi in Bryansk region \~17k BP, slightly post-Gravettian, hinting at proto-dog domestication around this time). In addition, recent analyses from the Kostenki 11 bone circle found **plant remains**: charred seeds and even remains of cooked **vegetable matter** inside the structure. This indicates that Gravettian groups gathered edible plants – perhaps wild root vegetables, berries, or nuts available seasonally – to supplement their diet. Though the periglacial steppe was not verdant, **cold-resistant plants** like wild onion, parsnip, or sorrel could have been foraged in summer, as well as fungi or lichens. The presence of grinding stones at some Pavlovian Gravettian sites in Central Europe raises the possibility of plant processing; however, such evidence is rarer in Russian sites. Still, isotope analysis of Gravettian human remains (e.g. from Sunghir) shows a high reliance on meat, especially herbivore meat, consistent with a trophic level of top carnivores in the food web. Overall, they were foragers with a pronounced tilt toward carnivory – effectively **megafaunal hunters and meat gatherers** – but they remained opportunistic omnivores when circumstances allowed.

* **Interaction with Megafauna Beyond Hunting:** The relationship between Gravettian humans and the Ice Age megafauna was not purely predatory; it also had symbolic and cultural dimensions. The frequent depiction of mammoths in their art (engravings on bones, mammoth-shaped figurines, etc.) suggests a cognitive reverence or fascination with these creatures. At Mezine (Ukraine) and perhaps Zaraysk, engraved patterns on mammoth ivory plaques have been interpreted by some as early calendar tracking, possibly related to hunting seasons of megafauna. Furthermore, the very act of building monumental structures from mammoth bones – “Bonehenge”-like rings – hints at ritual or ceremonial aspects. Some researchers propose that these circular bone enclosures might have been used for **ritual gatherings or feasts** centered on the mammoth, almost like sanctuaries celebrating the animal that sustained them. While concrete evidence of ritual use is elusive, the sheer effort to construct such features implies they were more than mundane homes. Thus, megafauna occupied a central place not only in Gravettian stomachs, but likely in their ideology and social life as well.

In essence, the subsistence strategy of the Gravettian peoples in Russia was a masterclass in Ice Age adaptation: **highly focused on big-game hunting yet flexible enough** to use all parts of the prey and to diversify when needed. They transformed the challenge of a megafauna-rich environment into an opportunity, building their camps, tools, and even art around the great beasts of the Pleistocene. This successful lifeway continued until the drastic climate downturn of the LGM likely disrupted the herds and habitats they depended on, contributing to the end of the classic Gravettian epoch.

## Climatic and Environmental Context

The world of the Gravettian was one of dramatic climate change and extreme environments. The period roughly 30,000–20,000 years ago corresponds to the latter part of Marine Isotope Stage 3 and the onset of **Marine Isotope Stage 2**, when global climate deteriorated toward the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM). Understanding the climate and environment of that time in present-day Russia is crucial to contextualizing how Gravettian people lived:

* **Periglacial Steppe Environment:** Gravettian sites in Russia existed in a **steppe-to-tundra landscape**, often termed the **Mammoth steppe**. This environment was a cold, dry grassland plain, with sparse tree cover (limited to patches of pine or birch in sheltered valleys) and extensive open expanses covered in grasses, sedges, and herbaceous plants. The term *“forest-steppe”* used in some descriptions of Kostenki is a bit misleading, as during the glacial period true forests were nearly absent in that region – instead it was mostly treeless or with stunted vegetation. Paleo-climate reconstructions show mean annual temperatures well below freezing and short, cool summers. The presence of permafrost is evidenced by cryogenic features in soil at archaeological sites, and indeed Gravettians took advantage of permafrost (digging pits to use as natural freezers). The loess (windblown silt) deposits at sites like Kostenki indicate a dry, windy climate with dust storms depositing sediments even as people lived there. Yet, the Mammoth steppe was surprisingly productive in terms of biomass – supporting large herds of grazers. The combination of herb-rich grassland and moderate moisture (from seasonal snowmelt and rivers) created a rich grazing habitat, which is why mammoths, horses, bison, reindeer, and other herbivores thrived, in turn attracting human hunters.

* **Glacial Climate Fluctuations:** The time span of the Gravettian in Russia saw significant climatic oscillations. When Gravettian culture first appears (\~30–28k BP), conditions were cold but relatively stable (a stadial, but not yet the coldest). However, by \~26–24k BP, climate records indicate a plunge toward the frigid extremes of the LGM. Around 25k BP (the age of the Kostenki bone circle), temperatures were extremely low and the landscape would have been at its most severe: effectively an **arctic desert** with permafrost year-round. The fact that Gravettians managed to build large structures and maintain habitations at that time is remarkable. They contended with short growing seasons for plants, migrations or die-offs of game, and limited fresh water in winter (rivers often frozen solid). As noted earlier, there is evidence that the **coldest interval (LGM proper)** forced a human retreat. In paleoclimatic terms, between \~24k and 20k BP the Fennoscandian Ice Sheet expanded to its maximum, though it never reached as far south as Kostenki, it made climates south of it extremely cold and arid. The **Central Russian Plain likely became depopulated** for a few millennia, as humans sought refuge in areas with slightly more warmth or moisture. Southern Russia (the Black Sea coast, Caucasus foothills) might have remained more hospitable and harbored remnant populations during the LGM. By \~18k BP, as the LGM eased, those areas served as sources for recolonization of the plains (Epigravettian reoccupation).

* **Adaptations to Cold:** The climate context necessitated certain human adaptations, many of which we see in the archaeological record. The use of tailored fur clothing (implied by sewing needles) would have been essential in the sub-zero winters. Dwellings insulated with bone, sod, and hide, and the heavy use of fire (bone fuel) also reflect adaptation to cold stress. The Gravettian diet’s heavy reliance on meat and fat – high-calorie foods – was well-suited to fueling human metabolism in cold conditions. Additionally, the cyclical climate fluctuations might explain some cultural developments: for instance, some scholars speculate that the **burst of artistic production (Venus figurines)** during Gravettian times could be partially linked to social responses to environmental stress, as groups possibly used shared symbols and rituals to solidify alliances when times got harder.

* **Landscape and Ecology:** The ecological setting of Gravettian Russia was unique: megafauna that have no analogs today roamed a biome that has since vanished. We can visualize the scenery at a site like Avdeevo 20,000 years ago as a broad, gently rolling plain with patches of snow, sparse tundra shrubs, and herds of mammoth and woolly rhino trudging along, while reindeer and horses gallop in large numbers under a pale sky. Predators like cave lions, wolves, and wolverines were also part of this ecosystem, competing with humans. Interestingly, the close coexistence of humans and large carnivores is attested – for example, cut marks and gnaw marks on bones show that humans and wolves/lions sometimes fed on the same carcasses (though whether they were competitors or humans may have kept tamed wolves is debated). The **Dniepr-Desna region** (today in Ukraine/Russia border) around 15–18k BP saw truly colossal accumulations of bones (Mizyn, Mezhirich, Yudinovo) suggesting a richness of prey even as the glacial era waned. By the end of the Gravettian (post-LGM), climates started shifting to warmer and wetter, gradually transforming the steppe-tundra into steppe-forest and reducing habitats for cold-adapted megafauna. This big environmental transition around 15k BP coincides with the ultimate disappearance of mammoths from these regions and the cultural shift from Epigravettian to Mesolithic. Thus, the Gravettian people lived at the **pinnacle of the last Ice Age**, exploiting its bounty and enduring its hardships, right before the world began to thaw.
