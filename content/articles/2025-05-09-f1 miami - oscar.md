Oscar Piastri: Leading the Championship and Hungry for More in Miami

Oscar Piastri hoists the winner’s trophy under the lights after a triumphant drive. Victories like the Bahrain Grand Prix have propelled me into the 2025 title fight. ￼ ￼

It’s hard to believe that five races into the 2025 season, I’m leading the Formula 1 Drivers’ Championship. I sit on 99 points, 10 clear of my McLaren teammate Lando Norris and 12 ahead of Max Verstappen ￼. Being at the top this early in the season is a fantastic feeling, but I know how quickly things can change in Formula 1. A 10-point lead can vanish in a single weekend, so there’s no room for complacency on my part. Instead, I’m heading into the Miami Grand Prix more motivated than ever to extend that gap and continue our strong run.

Holding the Championship Lead Against Fierce Rivals

Leading the championship means having a target on my back, and my closest rivals are exceptionally quick and experienced. Lando has been driving better than ever – he’s currently P2 in the standings on 89 points ￼ – and as my teammate, he’s using the same machinery, so I know he can match my pace on any given day. “We’re pushing each other every weekend,” I often say, because it’s true. Our intra-team battle has been incredibly close, and that friendly rivalry is driving McLaren forward. Lando keeps me honest; I can’t afford a poor session because I know he’ll capitalize. In fact, he’s always been strong at Miami – he had a stellar result here last year – which is extra motivation for me to raise my game.

Of course, one cannot talk about title rivals without mentioning Max Verstappen. Max might be sitting third at the moment with 87 points ￼, but as a four-time World Champion ￼ he brings a wealth of experience and racecraft. He’s had some bad luck this season – I saw first-hand his nightmare weekend in Bahrain where he only managed P6 and slipped to third in the standings ￼ ￼. But nobody in the paddock is naive enough to count Max out. I fully expect him to come back fighting; his determination to reclaim the title is unquestionable. In a way, having a champion like Max chasing me just adds to my focus – it’s a thrilling three-way battle for the title brewing at the moment ￼. I’m determined to keep the upper hand, but I know I need to perform at my very best each and every time I’m on track.

Importantly, our strong start isn’t just about the Drivers’ Championship – it’s also about McLaren leading the Constructors’ Championship. We’ve amassed 188 points as a team so far ￼, a testament to how well Lando and I are working together. It’s been a long time since McLaren was at the top of both championships, and there’s a real sense of pride and momentum within the team. We want to keep it that way, which means both of us continue to push the envelope while also ensuring we bring home the points for the team.

Reflecting on an Incredible Season Start

If you told me two years ago that I’d be leading the championship in my sophomore F1 season, I’d have found it hard to believe. Back in 2023, we at McLaren were struggling just to score points at some races. Yet here we are in 2025, with our MCL package transformed into a race-winning machine. The journey to this point has been nothing short of remarkable, and it’s been fueled by hard work and learning from every single outing on track.

The season opener this year wasn’t the smoothest for me – I only came away with a couple of points in Round 1, which was a bit of a wake-up call. But we hit back immediately. In Round 2, I took my first win of the season, which was an incredible feeling and really set the tone for my campaign. That victory made me the only driver so far to have won multiple Grands Prix in 2025 ￼, and it injected a huge dose of confidence into me and the team. From that moment, I knew we had a car capable of fighting at the front consistently.

Our early momentum carried into Round 3 at Suzuka. McLaren had won the first two races of the year, but our streak was snapped in Japan when Max clinched the win ahead of us McLaren boys ￼. I had to settle for P3 at the Japanese Grand Prix – not the top spot, but standing on the podium alongside Lando (who came in P2) was still a proud moment. It showed that even when we weren’t winning, we were right up there in the fight. More importantly, Suzuka proved our car could perform on a high-speed, demanding circuit. That gave us a lot of encouragement going forward.

Celebrating a crucial win in Jeddah. Victories on different circuits – from the fast sweeps of Suzuka to the street fight of Saudi Arabia – show the all-around strength of our McLaren this year. ￼ ￼

Then came the Bahrain Grand Prix under the lights, which was perhaps my most dominant weekend so far. I managed to secure pole position, led the race, and took the victory in Sakhir – a clean sweep that night ￼. Everything clicked for me and the team; the balance of the car was perfect and we executed our strategy flawlessly. That win was especially significant because it thrust me firmly into the title picture ￼. I went from 13 points behind Lando to just 3 points behind after Bahrain ￼, cutting his championship lead down dramatically. Moments like that really ignite the belief that this championship is within reach. I remember standing on the podium, trophy in hand, thinking how far we’ve come and how this was exactly the kind of performance we needed to sustain a title challenge.

We kept our foot on the throttle at the very next round in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia. That race was a rollercoaster in the opening laps – I had a tough wheel-to-wheel tussle with Max into the first corner, which got a bit hairy. Max received a penalty for that first-corner scrap, which took some pressure off me as the race unfolded ￼. From there, I was able to control the race at the front. I brought home the win in Jeddah, making it back-to-back victories for me and, crucially, vaulting into the lead of the World Championship ￼. It was my second win in as many weeks – an unbelievable high. I became the new championship leader leaving Saudi Arabia, a fact that still makes me smile every time I think about it. Two wins in a row also meant I cemented my status as the only multi-race winner in 2025 ￼ at that point, which in such a competitive field is something I’m quite proud of.

Looking back at these opening rounds, the common thread has been the strength of our car and the excellence of the team. Our McLaren is competitive on all sorts of tracks – quick city circuits, power-sensitive tracks, high-downforce traditional circuits – you name it. The car feels like it has no glaring weaknesses, which is a huge credit to everyone back at the factory. The upgrades and hard work put in after our struggles of 2023 have really paid off. We’ve gone from scraping into Q3 to locking out front rows and winning races. I’ve also grown as a driver since my rookie year, learning how to extract that last tenth in qualifying and how to manage the race pace when leading Grand Prix distances. There’s a calm confidence in our garage now; we know we can deliver when it counts. But we also know that staying at the top is an even harder task, and that journey continues this weekend in Miami.

Preparation and Mindset for the Miami GP

Leading up to the Miami Grand Prix, my approach is very much “business as usual” – with a little extra edge. The team has been working flat-out in the simulator and on the setup data to ensure we hit the ground running on Friday. Miami’s track presents some unique challenges, so our practice sessions will be all about dialing the car into those conditions. We plan to experiment with the setup in FP1 and FP2 to get the balance right for the hot and humid weather. Tire management is a big focus; the asphalt here combined with high track temperatures can really punish the rubber, so understanding how the tires behave over long runs in practice is crucial. I’ll also be paying close attention to the cooling on the car – both for the power unit and for us in the cockpit – because Miami’s heat can be brutal.

From a mindset perspective, nothing changes just because I have the championship lead. I approach this race the same way I approached the first five: aiming to maximize every session. “I’m not backing off just because I’m on top,” I remind myself. The goal for qualifying is absolutely to fight for pole position. Overtaking is possible at Miami with the long straights and DRS zones, but it’s never easy when everyone is so evenly matched – especially through the tight, twisty sections. So a strong qualifying position will make my life a lot easier on Sunday. I saw last year how Lando’s excellent qualifying (P5 in 2024) set him up to take advantage of the race incidents ￼ ￼. Starting up front is almost always step one to a successful weekend.

When it comes to the race, I’m targeting nothing less than a victory – expanding my championship lead is the objective. But I also have to be smart about it. Leading the points means I have to consider the long game: a risky battle that could end in a DNF is not in our interest. It’s a bit of a balancing act – I want to race hard and win, but I also know that sometimes banking solid points can be just as important for the championship. Given how close things are, every decision on track matters. If an opportunity for the win is there, I’ll seize it – I’m a racer, that’s what I live for. At the same time, I won’t throw away a podium with a silly move. Consistency wins championships, and we’ve done a good job so far at being fast and consistent.

Our strategy team has run through countless scenarios – safety cars, weather (though rain is unlikely in Miami’s climate this time of year), and even differing tyre strategies. We feel well prepared. I’ve also done my homework reviewing on-board footage from previous Miami races, including my own, to identify where I can improve. This circuit has some very specific challenges, and learning from past data is key. The engineers have a few new minor updates on the car this weekend as well – nothing huge, but every bit helps. We saw in 2024 that bringing upgrades to Miami paid off with a much stronger performance ￼, and we’re hoping for a similar step this year.

Mentally, I’ve taken a moment to embrace the fact that I’m arriving as the championship leader – it’s a little milestone for me personally – but once I put the helmet on, it’s all about executing the job. I’ve kept my routine the same: some sim runs, reviewing data with my race engineer, staying fit and hydrated, and getting in the right headspace. Confidence is high, but I remain respectfully wary of the competition. As my team often reminds me, “focus on the process, and the results will follow.” The process is performing at my best in every session here in Miami.

Tackling the Miami Circuit – Challenges and Past Lessons

The Miami International Autodrome is a venue that I find both challenging and exciting. It’s a pseudo-street circuit laid out around the Hard Rock Stadium, and it packs a little bit of everything into one lap. There’s the long back straight where we’ll be pushing well over 300 km/h and lining up overtaking moves into the heavy braking zone, and there’s also that tight Mickey Mouse chicane complex under the turnpike ramp that is second-gear and very technical. The high-speed sweep through Turns 4-6 feels great when you nail it, but the walls are never far away, so precision is rewarded and mistakes are punished here. It’s a track that demands respect. The surface was updated not long ago to improve grip, and we expect decent traction, but offline it can still be dusty. I’ll have to be careful when overtaking off the racing line because you can easily get it wrong if the track is dirty.

One of the biggest challenges here in Miami is managing the heat and humidity. It’s not just tough on the cars – it’s physically taxing for us drivers too. The cockpit gets extremely hot, and we lose a lot of fluids during the race. I learned in my first Miami race that staying hydrated and conserving energy throughout the weekend is vital. You can’t afford to be exhausted when it comes to those final laps on Sunday. We also have to watch the tires closely; the heat can send track temperatures soaring, which often causes higher degradation and makes finding the right setup tricky. But these are challenges every driver and team faces, so it’s about who adapts best.

For me personally, Miami has been a track of hard lessons. In 2023, as a rookie, this place was brutal for us. McLaren simply wasn’t a competitive force that year at this circuit – Lando and I only managed to qualify P16 and P19, and we went on to finish P17 and P19 in the Grand Prix ￼. I was actually the second-to-last car across the finish that day, which I won’t sugarcoat – it hurt. I was wrestling with a brake-by-wire issue throughout that race, which made our already difficult day even worse. At one point my brake pedal went virtually to the floor due to that failure, and our pace dropped off a cliff ￼ ￼. I still managed to nurse the car home, but coming away from Miami 2023 with no points and a lot of frustration was tough. It was a weekend to forget, but also one that taught me a lot about fighting through adversity. I remember telling myself afterwards that these hard days would make the good days even sweeter – and I was right.

Fast forward to 2024 and the picture was very different. McLaren brought some key upgrades and suddenly we were in the mix toward the sharp end. I qualified P6 for the 2024 Miami GP, just a hair behind Lando who was P5 ￼. From the second the lights went out, I felt much more competitive. I had a fantastic launch and jumped up from sixth to third on the opening lap ￼. Those first few laps were exhilarating – I even managed to overtake Charles Leclerc’s Ferrari for P2 by lap 4 ￼. For the first half of that race, I was running in podium contention and even had an eye on possibly challenging for the win. It’s amazing how much can change in a year; I went from struggling at the very back in 2023 to genuinely fighting at the front in 2024. That gives me a lot of optimism for what we can do in 2025 now that our car is even stronger.

However, the 2024 Miami GP ended in heartbreak for me. While I was battling in the top five, there was an incident that effectively took me out of the running. Carlos Sainz – who was with Ferrari at that time – slid into me on lap 39 while we were fighting for P4 ￼. It was just one of those unfortunate racing moments; he misjudged the braking and tagged the side of my car. The impact forced me to pit with damage. I remember the sinking feeling pulling into the pits, knowing a great result had slipped away. I got back out and pushed on, but there were too few laps left and I was well down the order. I ultimately crossed the line in P13 ￼, empty-handed. Meanwhile, Lando was able to capitalize on the chaos that day – he inherited the lead after some frontrunners had issues, and with Max picking up floor damage on a curb, Lando went on to take the win at Hard Rock Stadium ￼. I was really happy for the team that we got the victory, but I’d be lying if I said I wasn’t gutted to have lost my own shot at a podium (or even a win) due to that collision. It was a bitter pill to swallow at the time.

The silver lining was that I learned a lot from the 2024 Miami race. First, it reinforced that anything can happen in racing – sometimes the rub of the green doesn’t go your way. I also took away lessons in racecraft; battling wheel-to-wheel in those tight sections taught me how to better position my car and anticipate my rivals’ moves on this particular layout. And crucially, it proved to me that I could be fast here. So as I come back to Miami now in 2025, I do so with a mixture of caution and confidence. Caution because I know this track has bitten me before, and I need to respect it. Confidence because I’ve also shown I can conquer it – and with the car we have now, I believe I can fight for the win.

This weekend, I plan to take all those past experiences – the struggles of 2023 and the promising pace (and hard luck) of 2024 – and use them to my advantage. I feel like I have some unfinished business in Miami. The fans here are incredibly passionate and create a fantastic atmosphere, and I’d love to give them – and myself – a result to celebrate. Seeing the sea of papaya orange in the grandstands, even far from Woking, always fires me up. It’s time to turn Miami into a success story for me as well.

Eyes on the Prize: Expanding the Lead

Heading into the Miami GP race weekend as the championship leader, my objective is crystal clear: deliver another top performance and, if possible, stand on that top step come Sunday. I’m acutely aware that maintaining a lead in the standings requires constant effort – my rivals are right on my heels and will punish any slip-up. But this challenge is what I live for. Being in this position, fighting for a World Championship, is the realization of a childhood dream, and I intend to fight tooth and nail to keep this advantage.

My mindset is that of controlled aggression. I will attack the track and chase the win, but I’ll do so with the intelligence and maturity that this title fight demands. Every session – from practice to qualifying to the race – will be about optimizing and executing. If we can come out of Miami having expanded that points gap, even by a few more, it will be a mission accomplished. That would set us up nicely as we move into the European leg of the season. Races like Imola, Monaco, and Barcelona loom on the horizon, and carrying momentum out of the U.S. could make all the difference.

At the same time, I remind myself to enjoy this moment. It’s not every day you arrive at a Grand Prix leading the World Championship. I’ve worked incredibly hard to get here, and so has everyone in the McLaren team. Seeing our name at the top of the standings only fuels our hunger to stay there. There’s a quiet confidence within the team, but also a relentless determination – we know the job is far from done. Personally, I feel calm and ready. The nerves are there, naturally, but they’re the good kind of nerves – the ones that sharpen your focus.

In closing, I’ll say this: I’m here in Miami to race hard and race smart. I want to put on a great show for the fans and bring home a result that reflects the effort we’ve put in. Whether it’s battling my teammate, dueling with Max, or managing tricky conditions, I’ll face it with the same grit that got me this far. This championship fight is just beginning to heat up, and I plan on keeping it that way. With the sun shining, the championship lead in my pocket, and a fast car underneath me, I couldn’t ask for much more. Now it’s up to me to deliver when it counts. I’m ready for the challenge – let’s see what Miami has in store.
