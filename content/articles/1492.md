# Encounters with Indigenous Canoe and Raft Traders (1492–1526)

**Introduction:** European explorers of the late 15th and early 16th centuries frequently encountered Indigenous peoples navigating waterways in canoes and rafts. These first-hand accounts describe vibrant trade networks carried out by native traders in their own vessels. Below, we present structured evidence from contemporary sources – including the journals and letters of Christopher Columbus, the writings of chroniclers like Bartolomé de las Casas and Peter Martyr d’Anghiera, the letters of Hernán Cortés, and expedition accounts from the early conquest of Peru – each describing encounters with Indigenous traders in canoes or rafts. Key details such as location, the nature of the trade, the goods exchanged, and descriptions of the watercraft are highlighted with direct quotations from the original sources.

## Christopher Columbus (1492–1493): Caribbean Canoe Encounters

During **Columbus’s first voyage** in 1492, as he explored the Bahamas, Cuba, and Hispaniola, he observed the extensive use of dugout canoes among the islanders (most likely Taíno/Arawak people). On November 3, 1492, while anchored off the coast of Cuba, Columbus noted that **“many canoes came to the ships, to barter** with cotton threads and with the nets in which they sleep, called hamacas”. This journal entry – preserved by Bartolomé de las Casas in his abstract of Columbus’s diary – shows that the natives **paddled out to trade** textiles (cotton yarn) and hammocks in exchange for the Spanish goods. Columbus was impressed by the efficiency of this canoe-borne commerce and the honesty of the traders. On another occasion he remarked that the islanders loaded **“as many canoes as could load from the ship and discharge on shore… without so much as a needle being missed. ‘So honest are they,’ says the Admiral”**. These early contacts demonstrate that the Indigenous people had an established practice of bartering goods by canoe long before Europeans arrived.

In **Columbus’s report to the Spanish crown (February 1493)**, he provided further description of the native canoes he had seen throughout the Caribbean islands. He writes that **“on all the islands they have many canoes, somewhat like rowing boats… many are larger than an eighteen-bench galley… carved from one tree”**. Columbus even compares the speed and maneuverability of these canoes favorably to European boats: **“One of our galley boats wouldn’t be able to catch one of theirs, because they move in ways you wouldn’t believe”**. He observed that the islanders used these craft to travel and carry goods between the “countless islands” of the region, effectively **“bringing their merchandise with them”**. Columbus notes the impressive capacity of some vessels: **“I have seen some of these canoes with seventy or eighty men, each with his oar…”**, underlining the large size and passenger/cargo capacity of the dugouts. This is the first European record of the word *canoa* (canoe), adopted from the Taíno language. These descriptions make clear that **inter-island trade by canoe** was an integral part of Indigenous life in the Caribbean, with commodities like cotton cloth, foodstuffs, and other local products being exchanged. Columbus’s amazement at the canoe fleets – *“boats more than fifty leagues round”* navigating the islands – underscores how extensive the native maritime networks were.

## Columbus’s Fourth Voyage (1502): Maya Trading Canoe in Honduras

On his **fourth voyage (1502)**, Columbus encountered a dramatically different example of Indigenous seafaring trade – a large trading canoe off the coast of what is now Honduras. In August 1502, near the island of Guanaja in the Bay of Honduras, a **“richly-laden merchant’s canoe”** approached Columbus’s fleet. This big canoe, paddled by Maya traders (likely of the Yucatan coast or lower Central America), was essentially a **floating marketplace** filled with goods. Columbus’s son **Ferdinand Columbus, who accompanied the voyage, recorded a detailed description of this canoe’s cargo and the reaction of the Spaniards**. According to Ferdinand’s account, among the goods were **“some almonds that the Indians in New Spain used as currency”** – the first known European notice of cacao beans being used as money. He describes how **when a few of these cacao almonds fell to the floor of the canoe, “all the Indians scrambled to pick them up as if an eye had fallen out of their heads”**, indicating the great value these held in their economy.

Contemporary chronicles describe the **canoe itself as being as long as a galley**, wide enough to be compared to a European longboat. It was **manned by a large crew (reports range from about 25 up to 40 people)** and carried a **variety of trade goods**. The Spaniards marveled that the canoe’s wares were **“all of a quality superior to what they had seen before”** among the Indigenous peoples. They noted **fine cotton textiles (some richly dyed or embroidered), ceramic pottery, and tools or weapons** unlike those of the islands. One report lists **“ceramics, dyed cotton shirts, flint-edged swords (macanas), and small copper hatchets”** among the cargo. There were also copper bells and likely other trinkets. The presence of metal tools and woven cloth of obvious Mesoamerican origin indicated to Columbus that more advanced civilizations lay to the west. Columbus’s crew could not communicate well with these Maya traders (their interpreter spoke Arawak but not Mayan), yet they **“exchanged friendly signals”** and managed to barter: the Spaniards **“forced a trade, buying … with the usual baubles”** (trinkets) in exchange for some of the canoe’s goods. Columbus had the canoe’s elderly leader (the *nacó*n, or merchant captain) come aboard his ship to question him and even briefly **detained some of the traders**, hoping they might serve as guides or informants, though he later released them after taking a sample of their merchandise. This encounter at Guanaja is a vivid example of a **pre-Columbian long-distance trade network**: the Maya were trading items like woven cloth, cacao, and metal tools, possibly for **gold or coastal products** – for instance, Columbus noted they carried copper axe heads which might have been meant for trade with other indigenous groups. The Spaniards realized they had met people connected to the great civilizations of Central America, given the sophistication of both the canoe and its cargo.

*Context:* The account of the Honduran trading canoe comes down to us through Ferdinand Columbus’s **“Historie del S. D. Fernando Colombo”** (his biography of his father, written after 1537) and the writings of Bartolomé de las Casas, who also described this encounter in his *Historia de las Indias*. These primary narratives concur that Columbus and his men were astonished by the size of the canoe and the diversity of its merchandise. Las Casas, summarizing the event, wrote that the canoe carried **cotton garments, cacao, copper hatchets to cut wood, and other goods** – evidences of an extensive commerce – and that the quality of these items convinced Columbus he was on the threshold of a more developed coast. This meeting is notable as **the first recorded contact between Europeans and Maya traders**, and it provides a rare glimpse of Indigenous maritime trade in action.

## Peter Martyr d’Anghiera (1511–1525): Early Chronicler on Native Canoes

Peter Martyr d’Anghiera, an Italian-born historian at the court of Spain, never sailed to the Americas himself, but he collected eye-witness testimonies from returning explorers and published them in a series of letters and books known as the **“Decades of the New World” (De orbe novo)**. Through Martyr’s writings – which circulated in Europe by 1511–1525 – we have additional contemporary descriptions of indigenous watercraft and trading practices. Martyr confirms the extraordinary size and craftsmanship of the Caribbean canoes. Based on reports from Columbus’s voyages, he wrote that the **“canoes are constructed out of single tree-trunks… very long and narrow, and are made of a single piece of wood. It is alleged that some have been seen capable of carrying eighty rowers.”** This aligns with Columbus’s own claim of canoes holding 70–80 men. Martyr notes the Indigenous builders lacked iron tools – **“they dig \[the logs] out with tools of sharpened stone”** – yet were still able to create these impressive vessels.

Importantly, Martyr also documented instances of **native canoes being used for commerce and transport**. In one account, he describes how after Columbus’s flagship *Santa María* was wrecked off Hispaniola in 1492, the local Taíno people helped **“transport everything in barques which they called canoes”** from the stranded ship to shore, showing great helpfulness and honesty. He marveled that the islanders performed this task **“with as much alacrity and joy as though they were saving their own relatives; and certainly amongst ourselves greater charity could not have been displayed.”** This event illustrates not trade for profit, but the use of canoes in large numbers to swiftly move goods (the Spaniards’ cargo) – effectively a massive logistical effort by the Taíno. It impressed Martyr as evidence of the natives’ seamanship and capacity for organized activity via canoe.

Through Peter Martyr’s chronicle, European readers learned that the **Caribbean “Indians” traveled between islands by canoe to trade and communicate**. He even recounts sightings of warlike Carib groups conducting raids in large canoes. For example, he mentions an occasion where **“a canoe was seen in the distance carrying eighty men, all of whom were young… and armed with shields, which is not the custom among the other islanders”** – likely describing a Carib war canoe encountered by Columbus’s men near the Lesser Antilles. While this particular encounter was martial rather than commercial, Martyr’s inclusion of it shows the range of purposes for which these vessels were used: trade, travel, warfare, and transport. In sum, Martyr’s **early 16th-century writings** corroborate the direct eyewitness reports, emphasizing the **large capacity, fine construction, and integral role of canoes in Indigenous Caribbean society** for conducting commerce and other interactions.

## Hernán Cortés (1520): Canoe-Borne Commerce in the Aztec Capital

Far to the west, in the Aztec Empire of Mexico, Spanish conquistador **Hernán Cortés** encountered a highly developed urban civilization where canoes were essential for trade. In his famous **Second Letter to Emperor Charles V (dated October 30, 1520)**, Cortés describes the grand city of Tenochtitlán and its surrounding region. The city was built in the middle of a lake and interconnected with other settlements by waterways. Cortés was astonished by the scale of **commerce conducted via canoes on the lakes** of the Valley of Mexico. He explains that a narrow strait links the two great lakes (Texcoco and Xochimilco), **“and by this means a trade is carried on between the cities and other settlements on the lakes in canoes without the necessity of traveling by land.”** Thus, the numerous towns around the lakes were connected by a constant traffic of boats, forming a busy aquatic trade network.

Cortés goes on to describe Tenochtitlán itself, noting that many of its streets were actually canals: **“some of \[the streets], and all the inferior ones, are half land and half water, and are navigated by canoes”**. He observed that every day, **at the city’s numerous market landing areas, countless canoes arrived loaded with provisions and merchandise for sale**. In fact, the Aztecs had a system of customs or tolls for goods coming in by boat: **“at all the entrances of the city, and in those parts where the canoes are discharged… persons \[are] stationed as guards, who receive a certain sum of everything that enters”** as tax. Cortés was particularly impressed by the main market of Tenochtitlán (Tlatelolco), where **“more than sixty thousand souls”** gathered daily to trade all manner of products. He enumerates a dazzling array of goods available – **foodstuffs, textiles, jewels, metals, implements, and much more** – much of which arrived via the canal system. From his letter it is clear that **Indigenous merchants routinely used canoes to bring in corn, fruits, vegetables, fish, game, pottery, cotton cloth, and other wares** from the lakeshore gardens and neighboring towns to the city’s markets.

This is a striking example of **a complex, urban economy dependent on canoe transportation**. To Cortés and his men, who had never seen a city with canals like this (comparable only to Venice in Europe), the sight of thousands of canoes ferrying goods was extraordinary. They noted that the entire lake was “navigated by boats” over great distances. Cortés’s account emphasizes both the scale and efficiency of this system: the Aztecs had **specialized merchant guilds (pochteca)** and an organized infrastructure to manage trade – and the humble canoe was the backbone of daily commerce, from hauling fresh water into the city to delivering market produce. The Spaniards’ encounter with this bustling canoe traffic at Tenochtitlán revealed an Indigenous trading economy far more complex than anything they had seen in the Caribbean, reinforcing that **large cities in the Americas were supported by extensive canoe-borne trade networks**.

## Francisco Pizarro’s Expedition (1526): An Inca Trading Raft on the Pacific

In 1526, Spanish explorers probing the Pacific coast of South America (the early efforts of **Francisco Pizarro** prior to the conquest of the Inca Empire) had a remarkable encounter off the coast of modern-day Ecuador. **Bartolomé Ruiz**, Pizarro’s chief navigator, sailed south of the equator and became the first European to **encounter a balsa wood raft used by Indigenous traders** of the region. This event, recorded by contemporary chroniclers, represents the meeting of Spaniards with the maritime traders of the Inca realm or their affiliates. A Spanish report from that voyage describes how **“\[the Spanish] captured a ship \[raft] with as many as 20 men aboard”** in the open ocean. The vessel was **so large and well-constructed** that it could carry substantial cargo: **“up to 30 *toneles* (about 25 metric tons)”** in capacity. Unlike the canoes of the Caribbean, this was a multi-log raft – the Spanish called it a *balsa*, after their word for “raft” – with advanced features. The **“keel” was made of thick logs (as thick as posts) bound together with ropes of henequen fiber** (maguey, a type of agave hemp). On top of these floats it had **an upper deck of lighter cane, kept the people and cargo dry while the lower logs were awash**. In other words, it was a stable, two-tier design: seawater could wash through the lower logs without damaging the goods on the platform above. The raft was also equipped with **masts and cotton sails in a lateen (triangular) rig, much like European ships**, and even carried **stone anchors** for mooring. This sophisticated design astonished the Spaniards; one chronicler noted that such rafts were **“very safe vessels because they cannot sink or capsize”**, since water passes through them rather than flipping them.

Equally intriguing was the **cargo and purpose** of this raft. The Spanish accounts make clear it was a **trading vessel, operated by native merchants most likely under the Inca empire’s influence** (the people aboard were described as subjects or vassals of the Incas). After a brief skirmish – some of the crew jumped overboard, and the Spanish detained a few others to serve as interpreters – the Spaniards examined the goods being transported. **Francisco de Xerez**, Pizarro’s secretary who chronicled these events (in his *Verdadera relación de la conquista del Perú*, 1534), wrote that the raft carried **“silver objects, tiaras, crowns, bands, tweezers and bells, all of this they brought to exchange for some \[sea] shells.”**. In other words, the native traders were carrying a cargo of worked silver ornaments and other valuables which they intended to trade, reportedly for *Spondylus* shells (large red spiny oyster shells highly valued in Andean cultures as ritual offerings and currency). Other reports mention that the raft also carried textiles and beads; indeed, one of Pizarro’s men later testified that it had “rich cloth, and many things” including **“much merchandise of the Indians”**. The items like silver crowns and bells suggest these traders were likely from coastal areas under Inca rule, exchanging inland precious goods for coastal products (shells or fish).

The Spaniards’ detailed description of the raft underscores how impressed they were by this seagoing craft. They realized that the Incas (or their coastal traders) **“navigate all along this coast”** using such vessels, which could travel long distances with heavy cargo. This encounter was pivotal: it gave the Spanish a first glimpse of the wealth of the Inca Empire before they ever set foot in it – the silver ornaments on the raft hinted at riches in the interior. It also demonstrated that **the Inca and their neighbors engaged in organized maritime trade** along the Pacific, using technology adapted to local materials (balsa wood and plant fiber). The event is well documented by multiple chroniclers (Xerez, Miguel de Estete, and others), who consistently marveled at the ingenuity of the native raft and the sophistication of the trade goods. In sum, the **1526 balsa raft encounter** reveals an extensive Indigenous trade system on the west coast of South America, one that functioned prior to European contact and that utilized large sailing rafts to move commodities like textiles, precious metals, and shells up and down the coast.

The above accounts, drawn from **firsthand journals, letters, and early chronicles**, vividly portray how Indigenous peoples across the Americas were active traders on rivers, lakes, and open seas. From the **canoe-borne barter networks of the Caribbean**, to the **Maya trading canoe on the Central American coast**, to the **bustling canoe traffic of the Aztec capital**, and the **sailing rafts of the Andean coast**, Europeans repeatedly encountered well-developed maritime commerce. These records not only provide historical evidence of such encounters, but also offer rich descriptions of the watercraft themselves – **dugout canoes and woven rafts – and their impressive capacities.** The table below summarizes key references and details from each of these encounters, with source information:

| **Christopher Columbus – Journal** (preserved by Las Casas) | 3 Nov 1492, off Cuba (Caribbean)           | Taíno/Arawak in dugout canoes                                    | Islanders came out in **canoes** to the Spanish ships to **barter cotton thread and hammocks** (nets for sleeping). Columbus notes **“many canoes came to the ships, to barter”** goods like cotton yarn and the hammocks they sleep in. This shows inter-island trade goods being exchanged; the natives traded honestly and eagerly.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |

He saw some canoes holding **“seventy or eighty men, each with his oar”**. Natives **“navigate… bringing their merchandise with them”** between the “countless islands”. This emphasizes the extensive commerce by canoe (e.g. carrying cotton cloth, food, etc.) among the islands.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |

It carried **rich goods**: e.g. woven cotton clothing, colorful textiles, pottery, copper tools and ornaments, and cacao beans used as currency. Ferdinand Columbus writes they had **“some almonds \[cacao] that the Indians used as currency”**, and notes how carefully the traders guarded them. The Spaniards marveled that the goods were **“of quality superior to anything seen before”**, and traded trinkets for some ceramics, cotton textiles, flint knives, and copper hatchets. This was the first contact with **Maya long-distance traders** in their canoe. |
